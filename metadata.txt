about=This plugin provides a set of tools for interacting with vector layers in QGIS. It allows users to select vector layers with point geometries, click on the map to get coordinates in WGS 84 (EPSG:4326) format, and display the nearest address using the BAN (Base Adresse Nationale) database. Additionally, users can input a distance to find features within a specified radius and visualize a buffer zone around the clicked point. This plugin requires QGIS 3.x and Python with PyQGIS. It is designed to assist in spatial analysis tasks by providing easy access to geographic information directly from the map canvas.
